    "description": "I'm developing a portfolio website using React and TypeScript for the frontend. The site is designed for user interaction, allowing them to view my projects dynamically. The project's data is managed via a specialized tool I created in Python, which interfaces with the GitHub API and the OpenAI API to gather and process information into JSON files, organizing the data efficiently. It includes a project editor screen with AI capabilities, enabling easy creation of descriptions, and can even generate basic descriptions from a project's README.md file. The frontend reads these JSON files to build project views, providing detailed and current project information. I'm creating this site to allow people to see my projects. The tool I made with Python pulls information from GitHub and OpenAI, organizing the details into easy-to-read files. \n\nIt helps create project descriptions and can even write ones based on existing content, showcasing all about my projects.",
